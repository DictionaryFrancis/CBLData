# CBLData
 
Welcome to Project CBLData!

Project CBLData aims to assist in the development of a league statistic. In its initial phase, the goal is to establish an easy-to-use method for observing data from a website, allowing users to visualize information without navigating to the web.

The primary objective is to showcase the power and usefulness of data mining, illustrating how it can empower teams to continuously improve their performance in each game.

The main functionality involves generating PDF reports containing the latest results of teams. This enables teams to review recent outcomes, compare victories and losses with other teams, and evaluate their own performance.
